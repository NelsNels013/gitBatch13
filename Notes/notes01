Architecture of git

3-stage architecture working directory, staging area,repo

working directory--------->>>>>>


gitproject1---> pom,src,target, .idea

where should you create your local git repository?
ideally you should create your repo inside your working directory i.e in this case gitProject1

Notes
one repo for one single project
no subRepos are advised

-------------------------------------Tracking your first git project-------------------------------------------

1. Decide the location where to create the repository and navigate my MR terminal to that particular directory
2. Initialize an empty repository git init ---> to initialize an empty repository

to delete a repo, simply delete the .git folder

3. git status--> shows you untracked files in red color
             --> shows you tracked files in green color

4. git add . --> moves all the files to the staging area . .

5. git commit -m "commit message" --> sends all the files from staging area to the local repo

6. git status after the commit shows working tree clean because we have
all the three stages i.e working directory, staging area and local repo synchronized
